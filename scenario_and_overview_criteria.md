## Scenario

In the rapidly evolving landscape of academia, collaboration and knowledge sharing play a pivotal role in advancing research and fostering intellectual growth. 
This fosters a culture of open-access knowledge sharing and transparency within the academic community and to provide a platform for mentoring and skill development through collaborative coding and project management practices.
