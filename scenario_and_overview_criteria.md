## Scenario

You are a senior professor at an academic institution and you are trying to create a centralized hub for researchers, scholars, and students to collaborate on projects, share resources, and contribute to the academic community's collective knowledge. 
In the rapidly evolving landscape of academia, collaboration and knowledge sharing play a pivotal role in advancing research and fostering intellectual growth. 
This fosters a culture of open-access knowledge sharing and transparency within the academic community and to provide a platform for mentoring and skill development through collaborative coding and project management practices. 


## Overview

In Part 1, you will:

Task 1. Set up a New GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository named  `Centralised_hub_for_knowledge_sharing--ABC-05-College` for your academic community project.

Task 2. Organize Project Folder:
Add a project folder in the lab environment which will have:
- Your main project name: Shipping Calculator
- Your name
- Your department,section and roll number separated by a hyphen (" - ")

So, if your details are:
- Name: `John Doe`
- Department: CS (ie. Computer Science)
- Section: S01  (ie. 1st section)
- Roll number: 25

You need to name your Project folder as `Shipping Calculator-CS-S01-25` . Please ensure using this nomenclature.

Task 3. Establish a Remote Origin:

Add your remote GitHub repository as a remote origin.

Commit & Push your project folder from the lab environment to it.


In Part 2, you will:

Task 4. Clone the repository to which you pushed your project folder.

Task 5. Create a branch named `HTML`:

- Switch to the HTML branch
- Add a file named shipping_calculator.html inside your project folder.
- Add content to it.

Task 6. Push to the `HTML branch`
** Follow similar process as Exercise 1 & 2 of Parctice Project we created initially
- Commit and push these changes to the `HTML` branch.
- Show the process of Allow -> Entering username -> Entering PAT for Lab env( DO NOT USE THE TERM "THEIA" ANYWHERE) to Github push as a NOTE


Task 7. Merge this to the `main` or `master` branch through a Pull and merge request.
** Follow similar process as Exercise 3 of Parctice Project we created initially

Task 8. Create a branch named `Javascript`, push to it, and merge it to the `main` or `master` branch

- A file named shipping_calculator.js should be created inside the project folder in this branch.
- Rest of the process is similar to Tasks 4 -7.

** LEANERS WILL PRACTICE WHAT THEY DID IN TASKS 4-7 HERE. Give commands & screenshots AS HIDDEN SECTIONS in instructions & ONLY the task requirement normally.

## COMMENTS - ONLY FOR REFERENCE
Ask learners to create a repo - give them a specific. name  for the repo - Centralised hub for knowledge sharing - ABC College
 
- project folder with their project name and their name in the end with section name:  for eg Shipping Calculator - XYX-RollNumber - Section Name 
In the project folder ask them tp create one shipping.html file and shipping.js file 
In the shipping.html file ask them to add a piece of code...<html><body>  This is just for practice. Do not add code here. </body></html>
 
In the shipping.js file and add this code ...ask them to write a comment - This is the starting js file for my shipping calculator.
 
rest operations can be performed. - operations that are in the fp...do that on this
