## Scenario

You are a student at a college and wish to contribute your project to the college.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of academia, collaboration and knowledge sharing play a pivotal role in advancing research, and fostering intellectual growth. This fosters a culture of open-access knowledge sharing and transparency within the academic community. It also provides a platform for mentoring and skill development through collaborative coding and project management practices.

So, you are provided with a Common repository by your college which acts a Centralized reource sharing hub for all students. 

<br>

#### This Practice Project consists of 2 Parts:

#### Part 1:

1. You will fork the centrailzed repository in order to have your own separate repository as a student and a collaborator.

2. Then, you will add project folders and a contribution guideline file in the lab enviornment.

3. Then, you will push the changes from the lab environment to your repository.
<br>

#### Part 2

1. You will clone the repository you had updated in Part 1.

2. Next, you will create a local branch for an HTML project that you wish to contribute to your college.

3. Further, you will commit and push these files to the locally created branch, and then merge them to the main/master branch.

4. Finally, for contributing your project to the college you will raise a pull request from your forked repository to the original upstream repository (the centralized reposutory of the college from which you had created your fork).
> This pull request will further be closed or merged by the college authorities after they review it.

5. You will do the same process for another Javascript project that you wish to contribute to the college as well.
