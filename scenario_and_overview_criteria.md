## Scenario

You are a student at a college and wish to contribute your project to the college.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of academia, collaboration and knowledge sharing play a pivotal role in advancing research and fostering intellectual growth.  This fosters a culture of open-access knowledge sharing and transparency within the academic community and to provide a platform for mentoring and skill development through collaborative coding and project management practices. 

This Practice Project consists of 2 Parts:

** Part 1:**

You will fork the centrailzed repository in order to have your own separate repository as a student and a collaborator. You will add project folders and a contribution guideline file in the lab enviornment and push it to your repo. 

** Part 2: **
You will clone the forked repository which now has your project folders and the contrubituonb guideline file. You will create 2 branches for 2 projects - HTML and Javascript, that you wish to contribute to your college. You will commti and push these files first to the branch, and then to the main/master branch of your forked repo. 

In order to contribute it to the college you will raise a pull request to the original upstream repository (the centralized reposutory of the college from which you had created your fork at the beginning). This pull request will further be closed by the college authorities after they review and find your project suitable for the college & academic community.


## Overview


** In Part 1, you will:  **

Task 1. Set up a New GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository named  `Centralised_hub_for_knowledge_sharing--ABC-05-College` for your academic community project.

Task 2. Organize Project Folder:
Add a project folder in the lab environment which will have:
- Your main project name: Shipping Calculator
- Your name
- Your department,section and roll number separated by a hyphen (" - ")

So, if your details are:
- Name: `John Doe`
- Department: CS (ie. Computer Science)
- Section: S01  (ie. 1st section)
- Roll number: 25

You need to name your Project folder as `Shipping Calculator-CS-S01-25` . Please ensure using this nomenclature.

Task 3. Establish a Remote Origin:

Add your remote GitHub repository as a remote origin.

Commit & Push your project folder from the lab environment to it.

<br>

** In Part 2, you will: **

Task 4. Clone the repository to which you pushed your project folder.

Task 5. Create a branch named `HTML`:

- Switch to the HTML branch
- Add a file named shipping_calculator.html inside your project folder.
- Add content to it.

Task 6. Push to the `HTML branch`
** Follow similar process as Exercise 1 & 2 of Parctice Project we created initially
- Commit and push these changes to the `HTML` branch.
- Show the process of Allow -> Entering username -> Entering PAT for Lab env( DO NOT USE THE TERM "THEIA" ANYWHERE) to Github push as a NOTE


Task 7. Merge this to the `main` or `master` branch through a Pull and merge request.
** Follow similar process as Exercise 3 of Parctice Project we created initially

Task 8. Create a branch named `Javascript`, push to it, and merge it to the `main` or `master` branch

- A file named shipping_calculator.js should be created inside the project folder in this branch.
- Rest of the process is similar to Tasks 4 -7.

** LEANERS WILL PRACTICE WHAT THEY DID IN TASKS 4-7 HERE. Give commands & screenshots AS HIDDEN SECTIONS in instructions & ONLY the task requirement normally.
